# pinggraph

**pinggraph** is a nim reimplementation of [lagraph](https://github.com/Calinou/lagraph), which is a command-line utility that draws a ping graph.

## Motivation
Why rust and not nim?

## Features
Literally the same as [lagraph](https://github.com/Calinou/lagraph#features).
This is line by line reimplementation.

# pinggraph

**pinggraph** is a nim reimplementation of [lagraph](https://github.com/Calinou/lagraph), command-line utility that draws a ping graph.

## Motivation
Why rust and not nim?

## Installation
With [Nim](https://nim-lang.org) toolchain installed: `nimble install pinggraph`

## Features
~~Literally the same as [lagraph](https://github.com/Calinou/lagraph#features).
This is line by line reimplementation.~~
Now with some deviations, like more precise graph and statistics report.
